# My Portfolio

## Description

Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Sheena Mugo, and I'm a beginner software engineer. This project showcases my journey in learning web development. I've created a personal website to share a bit about myself, my skills, and how to contact me.

## Features

- **Navbar**: A simple navigation bar that lets visitors jump to different sections of the page, like About, Work, and Contact.
- **Profile Section**: A place where I introduce myself and share my interests in software engineering. I included my image and a short description of my skills.
- **About Section**: Here, I provide details about myself, including my name, languages I speak, and my education background.
- **School Background**: I have listed my education timeline, from primary school to my current studies.
- **Contact Section**: A way for visitors to reach out to me, including links to my social media and a contact form.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS

## Getting Started

To view my portfolio, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You can explore different sections and learn more about me!

## Future Improvements

I plan to continue improving my portfolio by:
- Adding more projects Iâ€™ve worked on.
- Enhancing the design and layout with advanced CSS techniques.
- Learning JavaScript to make the site interactive.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I'm excited to keep learning and growing as a software engineer.

## JavaScript Functionality

In my portfolio, I included a simple JavaScript file (`script.js`) to enhance user interactivity. This script listens for a click event on the "More About Me" button. When the button is clicked, an alert pops up, providing visitors with a brief introduction about me as a Software Engineer. 

This functionality aims to engage users and encourage them to connect with me, showcasing my passion for building innovative solutions.
